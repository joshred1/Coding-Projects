# Coding-Projects
This Repository is a collection of some of the projects I had worked on during university and an ever-growing collection of side projects I'll be working on today and into the future. The collection is broad in the sense that it spans projects across various fields and coding platforms, encompassing mathematical problems, statistical modelling, data analysis, games of chance, and particularly focuses on problems in actuarial science and financial modelling.
