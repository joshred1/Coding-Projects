# Coding-Projects
This Repository is a collection of some of the projects I had worked on whilst at university. This collection is broad in the sense that it spans work across various fields and coding platforms, including mathematical problems, statistical modelling and data analysis problems, and particularly problems focused in actuarial science and financial modelling.
