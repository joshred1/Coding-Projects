# Coding-Projects
This Repository is a collection of some of the projects I had worked on whilst at university and an ever-growing collection of side projects I'll be working on. This collection is broad in the sense that it spans work across various fields and coding platforms, including mathematical problems, statistical modelling and data analysis problems, games of chance, and particularly problems focused in actuarial science and financial modelling.
